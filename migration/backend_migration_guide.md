# 🚀 Backend Migration to Workspace-Based CRM

## ✅ COMPLETED STEPS

### 1. Data Migration ✅

- [x] **Backup created**: 1,092 records safely backed up
- [x] **New tables created**: 6 workspace-based tables in Supabase
- [x] **Data migrated**: 100% success rate
  - 🏢 1 Workspace created
  - 👥 3 Users migrated
  - 📞 30 Contacts migrated
  - 💬 106 Conversations migrated
  - 💭 951 Messages migrated

### 2. Backend Code Updated ✅

- [x] **New service layer**: `supabase-workspace.ts` created
- [x] **Workspace context**: `WorkspaceContext` class for user-workspace mapping
- [x] **Authentication middleware**: `workspace.ts` for workspace-scoped auth
- [x] **New routes**: 4 workspace-based route files created
- [x] **Gradual migration**: Dual route system (v1 legacy + v2 workspace)

## 🔧 CONFIGURATION

### Environment Variables to Add

Add these to your `backend/.env` file:

```bash
# Migration Configuration
ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES=false
FALLBACK_TO_OLD_SYSTEM=true
LOG_MIGRATION_EVENTS=true
DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID=1
```

## 📊 ROUTE STRUCTURE

### Legacy Routes (v1) - Current Default

```
/api/v1/auth          → Original auth routes
/api/v1/conversations → Original conversation routes
/api/v1/contacts      → Original contact routes
/api/v1/analytics     → Original analytics routes
```

### Workspace Routes (v2) - New System

```
/api/v2/auth          → Workspace-based auth
/api/v2/conversations → Workspace-scoped conversations
/api/v2/contacts      → Workspace-scoped contacts
/api/v2/analytics     → Workspace-scoped analytics
```

### Primary Routes (Configurable)

```
/api/auth             → Routes to v1 or v2 based on ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES
/api/conversations    → Routes to v1 or v2 based on ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES
/api/contacts         → Routes to v1 or v2 based on ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES
/api/analytics        → Routes to v1 or v2 based on ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES
```

## 🔄 GRADUAL MIGRATION PROCESS

### Phase 1: Testing (Current)

```bash
ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES=false  # Use legacy as primary
```

- ✅ Legacy system continues to work
- ✅ New workspace routes available for testing at `/api/v2/*`
- ✅ No impact on production

### Phase 2: Soft Switch

```bash
ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES=true   # Use workspace as primary
FALLBACK_TO_OLD_SYSTEM=true    # Keep legacy as backup
```

- 🚀 Workspace system becomes primary
- 🛡️ Legacy system available as fallback
- 📊 Monitor and compare both systems

### Phase 3: Full Migration

```bash
ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES=true   # Use workspace as primary
FALLBACK_TO_OLD_SYSTEM=false   # Remove legacy fallback
```

- ✅ Workspace system only
- 🗑️ Can remove legacy routes
- 🎯 Production ready

## 🧪 TESTING

### 1. Start Backend with New Routes

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 2. Test Workspace Routes

```bash
# Get user info (requires Clerk auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_JWT" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/v2/auth/user

# Get workspace contacts
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_JWT" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/v2/contacts

# Get workspace conversations
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_JWT" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/v2/conversations
```

### 3. Verify Legacy Still Works

```bash
# Legacy routes should continue working
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_JWT" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/v1/conversations
```

## 🔍 KEY DIFFERENCES

### Authentication

- **Legacy**: Uses `authMiddleware` with client-based auth
- **Workspace**: Uses `requireWorkspaceContext` with workspace-scoped auth

### Data Scope

- **Legacy**: Data scoped by `client_id`
- **Workspace**: Data scoped by `workspace_id`

### Error Handling

- **Legacy**: Client-focused error messages
- **Workspace**: Workspace-focused error messages

### Context

- **Legacy**: `req.user` with client info
- **Workspace**: `req.workspaceContext` with workspace + user info

## 🛡️ ROLLBACK PLAN

If issues occur, rollback is simple:

```bash
# 1. Set environment variable
ENABLE_WORKSPACE_ROUTES=false

# 2. Restart backend
npm restart

# 3. System reverts to legacy routes
```

## 📈 NEXT STEPS

After backend testing is successful:

1. **Update Frontend**: Modify frontend to use workspace context
2. **Update API calls**: Switch frontend from `/api/v1/*` to `/api/v2/*`
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all features
4. **Production Switch**: Enable workspace routes in production
5. **Cleanup**: Remove legacy code after successful migration

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

- **Data Safety**: Original tables are untouched
- **Zero Downtime**: Legacy system continues during migration
- **Reversible**: Can rollback at any time
- **Gradual**: Switch happens incrementally
- **Monitored**: All migration events are logged
